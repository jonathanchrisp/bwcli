Please note that the config file enables us to hold multiple users which we can easily switch between.\r\n\r\n### Add new user to config\r\n\r\nIn order to use `bwcli` you need to have a `.bwcli` file in your root directory, don't worry I've got your back. When you create a new user the file will be created automatically. So, to get the show on the road add a user to your config file:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config add -u username@domain.com -p your_password -e enviroment\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you create a user for the first time `bwcli` will automatically set this user as your `current user`. When you add new users to your config, `bwcli` will ask whether you want to set this user as your current user.\r\n\r\n### View user config\r\n\r\nReturns the users currently stored in the config file along with the current user if set.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config list\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Set current user\r\n\r\nSets the user as the current user. The `set` or `switch` command can be used.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config set -u anotheruser@domain -e environment\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remove user\r\n\r\nRemoves the specific user from the config file, no warning is given.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config remove -u anotheruser@domain -e environment\r\n```\r\n\r\n### View current user\r\n\r\nReturns the current user set in the config file.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config user\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authenticate current user\r\n\r\nPlease note that when ever you make a request to an endpoint `bwcli` will ensure you are authenticated with brandwatch so the login command doesn't need to run everytime.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config login\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reset user config\r\n\r\nWipe your config file and restart, warning is given and the user must respond with a `yes` or `y` to confirm.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli config reset\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\nOnce you have your current user setup you can make API requests to Brandwatch. Currently at present only the `me` and `projects` endpoint are implemented.\r\n\r\n### Me Endpoint\r\n\r\nReturns user information.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli me\r\n```\r\n\r\n### All Projects\r\n\r\nReturns all projects the user currently has shared.\r\n\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Specific Projects\r\n\r\nReturns the specific project specified, user must pass option for `-i` parameter.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbwcli projects -i 12345678\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nI would be more than happy to recieve feedback, please email me at: jonathan.chrisp@gmail.com or jonathan@brandwatch.com\r\n","google":"UA-38101452-13","note":"Don't delete this file!
